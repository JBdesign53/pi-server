# Raspberry Pi Server

Home project using a Raspberry Pi to gather data and to make it available on the local network as a website.

Currently the server will:

* Run Node JS and Express.
* Display realtime and historic data through the website including:
  * Room temperature, humidity and barometric pressure.
  * Server CPU and RAM usage, CPU temperature etc.

Additional uses are also being considered for the server eg. UniFi controller.

I may transition to using Docker depending on how complex this project becomes.


## Hardware

* Raspberry Pi 4 model B
* Adafruit BME280
